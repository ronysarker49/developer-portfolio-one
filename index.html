            <h3>Tom & Jerry's adventure as they run around all day long</h3>
            <p>Tom & Jerry has been one of the most memorable characters for anyone growing up glued to their TV sets.
                Their
                quirky chases and over-the-top action sequences made them stand out, which kids dare not try at home.Tom
                &
                Jerry
                are categorized under the Mage class in the game. Mage class characters deal with long-range projectile
                damages
                rather than short-range quick combats. The game sticks to the duo's iconic chase and action moves and
                somehow
                manages to squeeze them down into the game. Something that might bring a smile to the player's face on
                first
                look.</p>
